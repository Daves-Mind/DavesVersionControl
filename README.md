# DavesVersionControl

Currently this is very simple, its just to track the changes to forms as they happen.

you can either just import the managed solution, or build it all yoursef.
totally up to you.

I plan to widen the features as we go, but the core will alwys be standalone and simple. 

Note the versioning happens on the publish, not the save of the form.
it slows it down by araound a second in total, whcih shouldn't really be noticable

Just put the solutions you wish to track into the enviroement variable. and give it a spin.
if you are getting a error on publish then please send me the plugin trace, and disable the step or uninstall the solution.

Thanks.

Dave
